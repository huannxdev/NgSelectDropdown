# NgSelectDropdown
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.0.2.
It's build based on Angular with Angular CDK without Jquery. Currently the project is in the development stage, I will try to complete as soon as possible. As my expectation it should work just as well as a PrimeNG dropdown and you can use it instead of having to install the PrimeNG library.I always welcome contributors, we can make it better together
